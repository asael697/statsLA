The main objective of this blog is to present some useful topics on statistics, machine learning, data science, and statistical programming. If you want to share a related topic, this is a space available to do so.

My main interests are Bayesian statistics, time series, non-parametric, and statistical programming. So the first posts will be on related topics. If you are interested in discussing or publishing a topic, please contact me.
