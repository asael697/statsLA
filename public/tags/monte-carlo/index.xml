      <description>Introduction Two major classes of numerical problems that arise in data analysis procedures are optimization and integration problems. It is not always possible to analytically compute the estimators associated with a given model and we are often led to consider numerical solutions. One way to afford that problematic is to use simulation. Monte Carlo estimation refers to simulating hypothetical draws from a probability distribution, in order to calculate important quantities of that distribution.</description>
